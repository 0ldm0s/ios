"_intro_04_" = "In order to immediately start using _brand_ you will be asked to enter a encryption key (minimum 4 characters, maximum 64 characters). The combination will be required just once and it cannot be modified. Should you forget it, you will never be able to retrieve it and your files will remain encrypted. Should you re-install _brand_ or access to your data from another iPhone, use the same combination you entered the first time.";

"_intro_09_" = "OFFLINE & LOCAL STORAGE";
"_intro_10_" = "You can tag the most important files or folders as 'Offline', so that they are copied and will always remain synchronized on your iPhone and they can be consulted offline.

"_intro_16_" = "Templates for recording your confidential data (note, credit card, ATM card, bank accounts, passwords to websites, etc…) are available and they can be saved in your Cloud in encrypted mode as well.";
"_intro_17_" = "PASSWORD LOCK";
"_intro_18_" = "In order to  prevent other potential users of your iPhone from accessing your _brand_, you can activate the 'password lock' directly from the settings. The password lock can be modified, disabled, or even used to protect access to individual folders.";
